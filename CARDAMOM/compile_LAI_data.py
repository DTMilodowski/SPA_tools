# This function essentially compiles together all of the available LAI data for the BALI
# project for ease of comparison and to facilitate their incorporation into the numerical
# modelling framework.  Sources of LAI data (and other relevant proxies:
# (1)  hemispherical photographs, processed with Hemisfer ->  LAI estimates for each plot
#      have been made at multiple points in time, providing a sparse time series of LAI
# (2)  LiDAR, processed either following Stark et al. (2012) or an alternative approach,
#      (Detto et al., 2015, improved by D T Milodowski et al., in prep).
# (3)  MODIS: 250 m resolution MODIS LAI from the latest MODIS LAI product: MOD15A2H
# (4)  Litter flux estimates
# (5)  Canopy volume estimates.
